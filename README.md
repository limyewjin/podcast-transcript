# Podcast Transcript

This project utilizes OpenAI's Whisper and GPT APIs to accurately transcribe, neatly format, and concisely summarize audio files. It is specifically designed to enhance your podcast experience, providing you with both detailed transcriptions and key takeaways from each episode.

## üöÄ Features
* Transcription: Convert your audio files into written text using OpenAI's Whisper API.
* Formatting: Clean and structure the raw transcriptions into a reader-friendly format.
* Summarization (Upcoming!): Extract the main points and themes from your transcriptions using OpenAI's GPT API.

## üìñ Getting Started
1. Click 'Open in Colab' to access the Colab notebook.
2. Follow the script inside the notebook.
3. For timestamp integrations, use:
```
$ python format.py --timestamps_file timestamps.txt podcast_transcript.json
```

## üéß Example
Check out a sample podcast [sample_podcast.mp3](https://github.com/limyewjin/podcast-transcript/blob/main/sample_podcast.mp3) and the resulting transcript [sample_podcast.json](https://github.com/limyewjin/podcast-transcript/blob/main/sample_podcast.json). 

Refer to [sample_timestamps.txt](https://github.com/limyewjin/podcast-transcript/blob/main/sample_timestamps.txt) for the timestamp data, and see the final [sample_output.txt](https://github.com/limyewjin/podcast-transcript/blob/main/sample_output.txt) for a well-formatted transcript.

See sample podcast [sample_podcast.mp3](https://github.com/limyewjin/podcast-transcript/blob/main/sample_podcast.mp3) which is from one of my auto-generated podcasts [YJ's Podcast #8](https://yjs-podcast.simplecast.com/episodes/yjs-podcast-8-aug-5-2023).

Running the colab on the podcast produces this transcript: [sample_podcast.json](https://github.com/limyewjin/podcast-transcript/blob/main/sample_podcast.json). Sample output below:

```
[
    {
        "id": 0,
        "seek": 0,
        "start": 0.0,
        "end": 11.6,
        "text": " Hello, and welcome to YJ's podcast, Episode 8.",
        "tokens": [
            50364,
            ...
            50944
        ],
        "temperature": 0.0,
        "avg_logprob": -0.2322188290682706,
        "compression_ratio": 1.4264705882352942,
        "no_speech_prob": 0.4174022674560547
    },
```

The timestamp data is: [sample_timestamps.txt](https://github.com/limyewjin/podcast-transcript/blob/main/sample_timestamps.txt)

```
