01:23 - All right, let's dive into our first story of the day.


# Timeline - 01:28 - Exploring 'Green' and 'Brown' Programming Languages

[Transcript]

01:32 - We're talking about green and brown programming languages. Now, if you're scratching your head wondering what we're talking about, don't worry. We're here to explain.

01:44 - This concept comes from a blog post by Adam Gordon-Bell, a software engineer with over 14 years of experience. He has a passion for functional programming and type systems. Currently, Adam works on static analysis of Docker containers at Tenable, but those are just his day jobs.

02:02 - In his free time, Adam hosts the popular Co-Recursive podcast, where he dives deep into technical topics of interest for software developers. So Matilda, what exactly are green and brown programming languages?

02:16 - According to Bell, green languages are those that are more likely to be used in new projects, while brown languages are more likely to be used in maintenance work. This distinction is based on the TOB index, which measures the popularity of programming languages.

02:32 - So how does this relate to the perception of these languages? Well, Bell suggests that the reason for the distinction between dreaded and loved languages is the maintenance aspect.

02:44 - Old code bases tend to become complex and harder to understand over time, leading to dread. Bell introduces a concept known as Joel's Law, named after Joel Spolsky, who writes extensively about software development.

02:59 - According to Spolsky, all non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky. This highlights a common cause of software defects. Programmers often rely on certain abstractions as fail-proof, but in complex systems, these abstractions can leak, leading to unexpected behaviors.

03:17 - This can make old code bases complex and harder to understand over time, contributing to the dread associated with certain languages. So if I'm understanding correctly, the languages people dread are often used in existing brownfield projects, while loved languages are more commonly used in new greenfield projects?

03:39 - Bell's analysis shows that 83% of the dreaded languages are brown, while 54% of the loved languages are green. That's a significant difference. But what does this mean for software developers and project managers?

03:52 - Well, it highlights the challenges of working with legacy code and the potential bias in evaluating programming languages. Newer or less popular languages may be seen as better because they are not associated with maintaining old code bases.

04:08 - So it's not just about the language itself, but also about the context in which it's used. And this could influence decisions about the adoption of new programming languages or the management of legacy code.

04:22 - This discussion makes me wonder about future trends in programming languages. Any thoughts on that, Matilda?

04:28 - Well, Dave, recent trends in programming are moving towards artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data. Languages like Python are popular because of their wide range of applications in these areas.

04:41 - There's also increased interest in languages like Scala for its strong capabilities. As technology shifts towards Internet of Things, blockchain, and quantum computing, we may see a shift in the most popular programming languages used in green projects.

04:57 - The green or brown classification of a language may shift over time as these trends continue to evolve. Fascinating stuff, Matilda. It's a reminder that there's more to programming languages than just syntax and functionality. There's also a human element to consider.

05:15 - And that's our deep dive into green and brown programming languages. We hope it's given you some food for thought.


# Timeline - 05:28 - Revolutionary Bioelectronic Medicine for Paralysis

[Transcript]

05:28 - Moving on to our next story, we're about to dive into a story that's nothing short of electrifying. It's a tale of technology, medicine, and human resilience.

05:39 - We're delving into a biomedical marvel, a double neural bypass that has restored movement and sensation in a man living with quadriplegia. For those who might not be familiar, quadriplegia is a condition that results in paralysis from the neck down, caused by damage to the spinal cord. Historically, it's been an irreversible condition.

06:01 - But that's where the Feinstein Institutes come in. They've been pioneering the field of bioelectronic medicine, which combines molecular medicine, neuroscience, and biomedical engineering. Their latest achievement is a double neural bypass, a groundbreaking technology that employs brain implants, artificial intelligence, and stimulation technology.

06:23 - Let's break it down a bit. When our study participant, Keith Thomas, thinks about moving his arm or hand, his thoughts are picked up by a microchip implanted in his brain. These signals are then sent to a computer, which interprets them and corresponds to Keith's desired movement. The computer then sends signals to highly flexible, noninvasive electrode patches placed over Keith's spine and hand muscles. This stimulates his muscles and promotes function and recovery.

06:48 - Meanwhile, tiny sensors at his fingertips and palms send sensory feedback, such as touch and pressure, back to the sensory area of his brain. This entire interaction is the double neural bypass.

07:00 - And the first person to benefit from this technology is Keith Thomas, a 45-year-old man from Massapequa, New York. Keith was paralyzed from the chest down after a diving accident in 2020. But thanks to this new technology, he's now able to move his arms at will and feel the touch of his sister holding his hand.

07:20 - What's even more remarkable is that Keith is already starting to see some natural recovery from his injuries. His arm strength has more than doubled since enrolling in the study, and he's beginning to experience new sensations in his forearm and wrist, even when the system is off.

07:36 - This technology could potentially forge new pathways at the injury site, similar to how a kidney can regenerate to overcome trauma or disease. It's not just about restoring movement and sensation. It's about potentially permanent recovery. It's a game-changer, to say the least.

07:54 - And it's not just about helping people living with paralysis. The Feinstein Institutes are committed to advancing new bioelectronic technologies to treat a range of diseases and injuries. From arthritis and pulmonary hypertension to Crohn's disease and diabetes, the potential applications of this technology are vast.

08:13 - And it's all thanks to the dedicated researchers, engineers, and surgeons at the Feinstein Institutes. It's a testament to the power of science and technology, and a beacon of hope for people living with paralysis.

08:27 - We'll be keeping a close eye on the progress of this technology and the impact it could have on the medical field. Indeed, Dave. With science and technology, the impossible might just be another hurdle to cross. Keith's story echoes the strength of our human spirit and signifies a beacon of hope for people living with paralysis.

08:51 - Let's continue with our discussion.


# Timeline - 08:52 - Exploring Fragrance-Induced Cognitive Enhancement

[Transcript]

08:54 - Today, we're diving into a story that's as intriguing as it is fragrant. Matilda, why don't you set the scene for us?

09:01 - Absolutely, Dave. Picture this. You're tucked into bed, the room is dark, and a gentle aroma wafts through the air. You're not just getting a good night's sleep, but you're also boosting your cognitive capacity. Sounds like a dream, right?

09:17 - It does, indeed. But this isn't just a dream. It's the reality of a study conducted by the UCI Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. They found that exposing older adults to different fragrances while they slept led to a significant increase in cognitive performance.

09:37 - That's right, Dave. The participants, all aged between 60 and 85, were given a diffuser and seven cartridges, each containing a different natural oil. They put a different cartridge into their diffuser each evening before going to bed, and it activated for two hours as they slept.

09:54 - Scientists have long known that the loss of olfactory capacity, or the ability to smell, can predict the development of nearly 70 neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia, Parkinson's, schizophrenia, and alcoholism. And recent evidence is pointing to a concerning link between smell loss due to COVID and ensuing cognitive decrease.

10:17 - If this concept of smell and memory is so well established, what makes the UCI study so unique, Dave?

10:23 - You could say the beauty of this research lies in its simplicity, Matilda. The researchers realized that it's not realistic for older adults or people with cognitive impairment to be exposed to a large range of scents every day. So they simplified the method. They reduced the number of different scents to only seven—one for each night—leveraging our ability to perceive smells during sleep.

10:52 - That's correct, Dave. And this drastic simplification made the study's findings crucially practical. Cognitive performance improved during sleep, making it an easily accessible method for individuals.

11:03 - The study's first author, Cynthia Wu, emphasized that making it possible for people to experience the odors while asleep eliminated the need for dedicated time for this during waking hours. And the results were nothing short of astounding. The group exposed to the full-strength fragrances showed a 226% increase in cognitive performance compared to the control group.

11:29 - That's a huge leap. It certainly is, Dave. But it's not just about the numbers. Imaging revealed better integrity in the brain's left uncinate fasciculus, a pathway connecting the medial temporal lobe to the decision-making prefrontal cortex. This pathway tends to become less robust with age. So not only did the participants' cognitive performance improve, but their brain health did too.

11:56 - And let's not forget the added bonus. Participants also reported sleeping more soundly. It's a win-win situation.

12:00 - Absolutely, Dave. This study, led by Cynthia C. Wu and Michael Leon, among others, from the UCI Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, is a game-changer. It offers a simple, non-invasive technique for strengthening memory and potentially deterring dementia.

12:19 - And this fascinating study isn't stopping here. The team is keen to investigate the technique's impact on people already diagnosed with cognitive loss.

12:28 - That's the other grand revelation, Dave. The researchers hope this study will spur more investigations into olfactory therapies for memory impairment.

12:38 - We're also excited to note a product based on their study, designed for people to use at home, is expected to come onto the market this fall. Talk about transforming science into tangible, real-world impact.

12:50 - A decade ago, who could have imagined that we'd be talking about strengthening memory and deterring dementia with something as pleasant and effortless as falling asleep amid gentle aromas? Yet, here we are.

13:01 - And it's all thanks to the tireless curiosity and innovation of scientists like those at the UCI Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory. That's right, Dave. And with this study, they've once again proven their commitment to pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the brain.

13:17 - We're excited to see where their research takes them next. Indeed, Matilda. It's a fascinating story, and it just goes to show how much we still have to learn about the brain and the senses.

13:28 - But for now, it's time for us to wrap up this deep dive. We hope you've enjoyed this journey into the world of cognitive science and the power of fragrance. Well, that's a wrap for today's episode of YJ's podcast.
